      <h2>CHARLIE AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY</h2>
      <p>Grandpa Joe tells Charlie the story of Mr. Wonka and the Indian Prince Pondicherry. Prince Pondicherry asks Mr. Wonka to build him a palace entirely out of chocolate. Mr.Wonka complies, building a palace with chocolate furniture, chocolate walls, and even hot chocolate running from the taps. When he finally finishes the palace, he cautions the prince to eat it quickly because it will not withstand the heat long. But the prince refuses and says he plans to live in the palace. Just as Mr. Wonka predicts, the palace melts during the next hot day and the prince wakes up in a chocolate swimming pool. At the conclusion of the story, Charlie questions Grandpa Joe about the truth of the story, which Grandpa Joe defends. He then tells Charlie that no one has ever been seen going into or leaving the chocolate factory. Charlie is confused at first, but he quickly realizes Grandpa Joe is right: whenever he walks past the factory, the gates are locked. But he also knows that there is work going on in the factory. When he asks Grandpa Joe who works in the factory, his mother interrupts him, calling him to bed before he can hear about the mystery workers.</p>
